  abstract  = {The behaviour of the tyre plays an important role in controlling the horizontal motion of the vehicle. In vehicle dynamics studies, a good representation of tyre behaviour is therefore a necessity. A series of tyre measurements have been carried out on the road in stationary conditions. The data obtained have been represented by mathematical expressions on the basis of a formula. The coefficients in the formula represent some of the typifying quantities of the tyre and the formula is capable of describing all characteristics of side force, brake force and self aligning torque with great accuracy. The behaviour of the tyre during combined cornering and braking has successfully been described by a model which makes use of the obtained mathematical expressions and some tyre-modelling theory. The side force characteristic governs the behaviour in lateral direction and the brake force characteristic in longitudinal direction. Thus, the non-isotropic properties of the tyre have been taken into account. Influences of ply steer, conicity, rolling resistance and camber are included as well. In this way a new and compact empirical model is obtained, enabling sensitivity studies to be performed. Vehicle dynamics studies have been carried out with the aid of simulations including the new model. This paper is a result of a joint project between Volvo Car Corporation, Sweden and the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.},

  abstract  = {One important road vehicle dynamics problem is the determination of the lateral stability of the vehicle. In this paper, stability results for a nonlinear model of the lateral stability problem are obtained using Liapunov's Second Method. The nonlinearities in the model are present because of the nonlinear relationships that exist between the lateral forces on the tires and the tire slip angles. Two Liapunov functions are presented which reproduce the well known stability criterion, the critical speed equation, for the classical linear model of the lateral stability problem. These two functions are then used to obtain stability conditions for the nonlinear problem. Finally, the stability results obtained with the two Liapunov functions are compared with each other and with digital computer simulations of the nonlinear equations of motion.},

  abstract = { For the first time, this paper investigates the application of the concept of Lyapunov exponents to the stability analysis of the nonlinear vehicle model in plane motion with two degrees of freedom. The nonlinearity of the model comes from the third-order polynomial expression between the lateral forces on the tyres and the tyre slip angles. Comprehensive studies on both system and structural stability analyses of the vehicle model are presented. The system stability analysis includes the stability, lateral stability region, and effects of driving conditions on the lateral stability region of the vehicle model in the state space. In the structural stability analysis, the ranges of driving conditions in which the stability of the vehicle model is guaranteed are given. Moreover, through examples, the largest Lyapunov exponent is suggested as an indicator of the convergence rate in which the disturbed vehicle model returns to its stable fixed point. },
