Simple vehicle 4 DOF
================================================================================

The linear version of this model is described by equations ?? and the nonlinear version of this model is described by equations ??.

Nonlinear bicycle model nonlinear with 4 degrees of freedom.

Description

The center of gravity of the vehicle is located at the point :math:`T`. The front and rear axles are located at the points :math:`F` and :math:`R`, respectively. The constant :math:`a` measures the distance of point :math:`F` to :math:`T` and :math:`b` the distance of point :math:`T` to :math:`R`. The angles :math:`\alpha_F` e :math:`\alpha_R` are the front and rear slip angles, respectively. :math:`\alpha_T` is the vehicle side slip angle and :math:`\psi` is the vehicle yaw angle. :math:`\delta` is the steering angle.
